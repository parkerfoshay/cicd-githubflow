# Parker Faucher's Take Home Assignment

* Here is the [PDF version of the slides](./Slides/MongoDB-Slide-Deck.pdf) and the [slide deck presentation on Google](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/194re6kxDcqaOAHMuKarTOMshiwjR-OOTtNbVbmLt2NM/edit?usp=sharing)

* The five minute activity is in the [Activity](./Activity/explainer.md) folder.

    * The activity has the learner use what they learned from the presentation in conjuction with the MongoDB documentation.

    * This gives the learner the opportunity to inspect the documentation on their own which is more akin to what a software engineer will do daily.

    * The learner also has the added benefit of putting what they just learned into their own words.

# Scope of Learners Knowledge

  This activity and presentation is meant for a learner that is familiar with the basics of MQL but has experience with relational databases. The activity is not exclusive to any programming language. The learner should have some full-stack experience in their history, but it is not mandatory.
